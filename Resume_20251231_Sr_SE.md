### Professional Summary  🌟

Senior Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience architecture and leading high-impact, large-scale software solutions. Proven ability to leverage cloud infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence algorithms and AI/LLM frameworks in distributed systems to solve complex business challenges—such as developing a customer intelligence platform that enabled real PSDA cycles in healthcare treatment using shewart charts and AI for signal detection. Combines deep technical expertise in full-stack development and graph databases with a talent for mentoring high-performing teams and aligning technical execution with strategic objectives.
### Specialties
- **AI Systems & Agent Orchestration:** Designed and built a 25+ agent delegation system with code-based plan validation, circuit breakers, and session memory to execute complex workflows via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
    
- **Multi-Modal Document Intelligence:** Created AI pipelines that classify and extract structured data from business documents (receipts, contracts) using vision models for scans and LLMs for text, enforcing output against domain-specific JSON schemas.
    
- **LLM-Powered Knowledge Synthesis:** Engineered systems that ingest video/audio to produce Zettelkasten-style knowledge graphs in Obsidian, featuring custom RAG with SciPy-optimized distance thresholds for precision retrieval.
    
- **High-Performance Data Infrastructure:** Built scalable pipelines using Redis for state/vector stores, HDF5 for time-series data, and FalkorDB for graph persistence, implementing processor patterns and file watchers for automated processing.
