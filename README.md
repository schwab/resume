# Cover
Congratulations, your search for a Sr AI Software Engineer is over!
(Insert your excitement and how great it will feel to soon say that out loud here  ;)

I know how it goes. In almost 20 years of both hiring and being hired, no matter which side of the interview table, I know the struggle, the search, the frustration, the doubt.  I approach every interview with a heart to share.  I know that a perfect candidate is not always about what fits on a resume. What we really need are loyal, honest and direct people that get vision and won't quit and continue to add value every-time they engage a business problem. I live to make things better and to engage with other wise and intelligent people and I know finding good ones is rare. So, no matter which direction  things go we talk I know the interview will be fun, challenging and informative for both of us.

I bring over 20 years of architecting high-impact systems and love the challenge of designing agentic AI frameworks using Model Context Protocol (MCP tool calls).  This includes, but is not limited to a recent custom 25+ agent delegation system platform and expertise that spans enterprise software development since ~2000. I love solving the complex business challenges others get lost in.  You'll see a great sampling of some of the scope in my resume and other project descriptions linked below.  Just reading them can be super-informative and is sure to inspire new ideas and create unexpected perspective.

Given my proven track record in LLM orchestration, MCP server development, and cloud-native AI and python solutions, is there any reason we shouldn’t schedule a meeting to discuss how I can immediately lead and innovate within your data and AI engineering initiatives?

Looking forward to talking with you soon,
