Congratulations, your search for a Sr AI Software Engineer is over!
(Imagine how great it will feel to say that out loud soon ;)

I know how it goes. In almost 20 years of both hiring and being hired, no matter which side of the interview table, I know the struggle, the search, the frustration, the doubt.  I approach every interview with a heart to share.  The correct fit and a dynamic interchange with intelligent, sincere souls is what I live for. So no matter which direction  things go afterwards, I promise the interview will be fun, challenging and informative for both of us.

I bring over 20 years of architecting high-impact systems that can be used by thousands or even millions.  I love a challenge and have hands-on expertise in designing agentic AI frameworks using Model Context Protocol (MCP tool calls).  This includes, but is not limited to a custom 25+ agent delegation system and designing and building scalable data pipelines AWS and docker to solve complex business challenges.  You'll see a great sampling of some of this in my resume. I also have other more in depth documents of my recent projects to share with those who want to go deeper. Just reading them can be super-informative and is sure to inspire and create a new perspective.

Given my proven track record in LLM orchestration, MCP server development, and cloud-native AI solutions, is there any reason we shouldn’t schedule a meeting to discuss how I can immediately lead and innovate within your data and AI engineering initiatives?

Looking forward to talking with you soon,
